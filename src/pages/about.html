	<h2>Emergency Housing Plan</h2>
	<p>The current housing crisis in Ireland did not
		happen by accident. It is the result of failed
		polices by successive governments who have
		relied almost entirely on the private sector to
		provide housing to residents in Ireland. This
		policy has resulted in devastation for hundreds
		of thousands of families across the state.</p>
		<p>Home Sweet Home is a campaign of housing
			activists, artists and trade unionists who
			believe the State cannot abdicate their housing
			responsibilities to the private sector any longer,
			and must now strongly intervene in housing to
			ensure everyone has a place to call home.</p>
			<p>Housing is not a ‘market’. It is a basic human
				right.</p>

				<h4>The campaign demands are simple, realistic and achievable:</h4>	
				<ol>
					<li>Declare a national housing emergency.</li>
					<li> Implement the Home Sweet Home Emergency Housing Plan.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>The Home Sweet Home Emergency Housing Plan can be broken into four sections.</h5>
				<ol type="A">
					<li>Address the needs of people who are homeless.</li>
					<li>Stem the tide of homelessness.</li>
					<li>Build for people, not profits</li>
					<li>Prevent a future housing crisis and ensure secure, affordable housing for all.</li>

<p>The Minister for Finance was recently exposed
stating that his policies in relation to housing
are to increase demand which will in turn
increase house prices making it profitable for
landlords and developers to invest. For this
policy to be successful, it would rely heavily on
a restriction of supply in the housing market,
and that is what is causing such devastation
through increased rents and property prices.
As Homelessness campaigner, Sister Stanislaus
Kennedy said, “ We have played the
market with people’s basic human needs. This
is nothing short of indecent.”</p>
<p>The private construction sector has openly
stated that they will not build housing until unit
prices increase so they can make a minimum
of 15 percent profit. Therefore, the failure of
the private market only leaves one potential
option, government intervention. Logically,
it also means that the government can build
housing at 15 percent less cost, at a minimum,
than the private sector, or could provide 15
percent more housing for the same costs.</p>
<p>Home Sweet Home is calling for the immediate
implementation of the following plans in order
to tackle the current housing and homelessness
crisis.</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide 1,000 ‘Housing First’ tenancies for
those in most need of immediate housing,
including those in homeless shelters and
chronic rough sleepers.</li>
<li>Provide a minimum of 1,205 homes for all
families currently in emergency accommodation,
clearing the emergency homeless list
within 12 months. Some families have been
in this situation for up to 2 years. Emergency
accommodation should be a maximum of 6
months and the State should be legally obliged
to provide housing at that point.</li>
<li>Provide a minimum of 10,000 new social/
public housing units owned by Local Authorities
and Approved Housing Bodies per year</li>
<li>Adequate funding for mental health, addiction
and domestic violence supports must be
provided.</li>
<li>All people who are homeless should be
allocated a key worker.</li>

<a href="#" class="accordion-title"><h4>B) Stem the tide of homelessness</h4></a>
<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
<p>On average, 60 families per month lost their
homes in 2016 and experts in the field of
homelessness believe that excessively high
figure will continue throughout 2017. </p>
<p>There are a number of measures government
could take which would reduce or potentially
eliminate that figure with almost immediate
effect.</p>
<ol>
<li> Implement the Focus Ireland ‘anti-homelessness
amendment’ which would prevent
landlords who had bought a property with a
buy-to-let mortgage, or availed of Section 23
property tax reliefs, from evicting tenants when
selling their house. This measure alone could
reduce new homelessness by up to one third.</li>
<li> Implement a moratoriam on evictions by
banks for those in mortgage arrears. There
are approximately 600 families losing their
homes annually due to bank evictions. If this
moratoriam were to be implemented, combined
with the above measure, it could wipe out new
homelessness almost immediately</li>
<li>Implement the demands of the ‘Secure
Rent’ campaign which would limit rent increases
to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) along
with providing more security of tenure.</li>
<li>End the practice of removing HAP and RAS
tenants from the primary housing list</li>
<li>A properly funded advice and information
campaign targeted at those at risk of homelessness.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>Provide 1,000 ‘Housing First’ tenancies for

	<li>Provide a minimum of 10,000 new social/
public housing units owned by Local Authorities
and Approved Housing Bodies per year
for the next decade in order to clear all social
housing lists. If the government continues to
provide social housing at the rate they did last
year (2015), it will take at least 1,200 years to
clear the social housing lists.</li>
	<li> Reinstate the 20% social housing requirement
under Part V of the Planning and
Development Act and legislate to ensure that
in Strategic Development Zones there is a
minimum requirement of 30% social housing.</li>
	<li>Work with Local Authorities, Approved
Housing Bodies, Credit Unions and local
communities to increase the provision of
affordable purchase and affordable rental
accommodation including through the use of
cost-rental, cooperatives, co-build housing,
community land trusts and other initiatives.</li>

<blockquote>“The right to housing is recognised in Europe
in the Constitutions of Belgium, Finland,
Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain
and Sweden and in the legislation of Austria,
France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the
United Kingdom. Around the world, the right to
housing is included in eighty-one Constitutions.
The right to adequate housing is provided for in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights, and the European Social
Charter. The right to housing if recognised in
our Constitution would be a major step towards
protecting people who are facing homelessness.
The right to housing in our Constitution
would put in place a basic protection in
recognition that a home is central to the dignity
of each and every person and a foundation of
every person’s life.”</blockquote>
<p>The Constitutional Convention, which was
established by the Irish government to
advise amendments to the Constitution, as
its first recommendation in 2014 suggested that the right to a home be enshrined in the
Constitution.</p>
<p><em>Home Sweet Home</em> is demanding a
referendum to enshrine the right to housing in
the Irish constitution based on proposals set
out by the Mercy Law Resource Centre</p>
