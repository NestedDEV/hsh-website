In 2015, there were 75 local authority houses built in Ireland.
At this rate it will take 1,200 years to clear the social housing lists..
That's if nobody else joins the lists.

SUPPORT GROUPS

Owen Keegan's comments that people "choose to be homeless" is the core of the establishment's response to the crisis. Their policy is shame isolation and stigma. We fight that by standing together. They caused this crisis but blame us. 

The same thing happened in Spain. Facing an enormous housing crisis because of bankers greed and private interest, housing group PAH started support groups. These are places where people affected by the crisis can come together to talk support each other and share ideas. A place for people to come together and not feel isolated.

They have spread to Ireland too.
